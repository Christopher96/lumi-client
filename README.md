## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:watch`

Runs the app in the development mode on the port set in your .env file.<br />

### `npm start`

Run this if you don't want automatic updates when making changes.<br />

## TODO / Suggestion:

    * Follower param on the join room command, this makes the the shadow folder be equalent to the src folder. Much like dropbox.
    * Manual rebase, copies all the files from the shadow folder into the source folder.
